The chart can also contain a short plain text templates/NOTES.txt file that will be printed out after installation, and when viewing the status of a release.

For example, instructions could be provided for connecting to a database, or accessing a web UI. Since this file is printed to STDOUT when running helm install or helm status, it is recommended to keep the content brief and point to the README for greater detail
